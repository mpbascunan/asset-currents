              <h2>Day 1 - 05/11/2032</h2>
              <p>
                I was awakened by the sound of a missile in the distance. I'm at home with my family but we ran out because we saw the fire approaching, we couldn't get any of our belongings out, and I only cared about my younger siblings. Another missile falls. We realized that the whole village is on fire.

                With my neighbors we tried to escape into the forest but it was also on fire. Luckily we found a canal where we could be away from the fire. We had no choice but to spend the night there.   
                           </p>

              <h2>Day 2 - 06/11/2032</h2>
              <p>
                It was a tough night. The fire was still going on and none of us had food. Some people drank from the canal's little water, but it was clearly polluted by the rubble of war.

              <p>
                I regularly heard someone crying, many people were hit by fire, or by missiles.              </p>

              <h2>Day 6 - 10/11/2032</h2>
              <p>
                The fire ceased but it was impossible to return to our house. Now it is part of a war field.              </p>
              <p>
                We decided to walk in search of food and water. Nobody comes to our rescue, the public authorities long ago stopped caring about the people affected by war. For them, war is a priority. 

                
              </p>
              <p>                We walked for many hours. We found some food and water along the way, but the intense heat, the penetrating cold of the night and the lack of food did not allow us to advance too far. 
              </p>
              <p>                We stopped to rest in a small town that had been hit by a missile, but there was no one alive there anymore.

              <h2>Day 9 - 13/11/2032</h2>
              <p>
                Finally, we arrived at a refugee camp. There are thousands of people living here and every day we are more. We are 10 people living in a small tent, we all have to sleep together to cope with cold at night since we only have one blanket. Sometimes humanitarian organizations come to bring us food and water, since we don't have running water.

              <p>
                I always liked to embroider, and here one of the refugees lends me her embroidery material, so when I have free time I dedicate myself to this hobby to don't to think too much.              </p>
              </p>
              <p>Sometimes it rains, then it snows, and the sun comes out again. The air is difficult to breathe due to pollution. Many people get sick, one of them is my little sister, but we don't have enough medicine to cure her. I try to take care of her every day preparing homemade medicines</p>

              <h2>Day 60 - 03/01/2033</h2>
              <p>
                It's been hard days since my little sister died. Every day I think about her and how she could never fulfill her dream of being a teacher. I wish that she could have lived in a world that would protect her from all dangers and ensure that she could live her childhood without the horrors she had to live through.

                
              <p>
                My parents are devastated. My mother has barely said a word and she cries silently all day. I would have liked to do more to save her, but I did everything I could.
              </p>
              <p>                In a few days we will cross the sea to look for better opportunities on another continent. We spent the little money we had left from what my father and brothers had earned working during these weeks.              </p>

              <h2>Day 66 - 09/01/2033</h2> 
              <p>
                The boat is quite old and looks fragile, but the owners are very violent so they don't accept any complaints. We have been moving very slowly, and the boat is too small for the number of people it carries. Also, I can see that there are many other boats in the same situation. We try to spread out the space so that everyone is comfortable, but food supplies look scarce.              </p>

              <h2>Day 70 - 13/01/2033</h2>
              <p>
                I know we will not reach our destination. Food and water supplies are at a critical level. We tried to find help but the other boats are in the same situation or worse. Since yesterday I began to see how people from other boats jumped into the sea accepting their fate. They soon started doing it on mine, and my father was one of them. We tried to convince him a thousand times not to do it, but he told us to take care of ourselves, that for him we were the most important thing and that he loved us. He drowned before our eyes.

              <p>
                There were few people left on board. The sea is crowded with corpses, and no land is seen in any direction. Many of those who remain are women and children, many have also died inside the boat from the cold. We all know what's going to happen, but it still keeps us alive a little hope.              </p>
